# Maya User Setup

This is a custom user setup to setup and initalize a maya workstation. 

## Installation

Copy the scripts into your Maya Script directory. After that, restart Maya.

To find your maya script directory, open up the Script Editor in Maya and run the following MEL-command:
```internalVar -usd;```

**Default locations** *Replace &lt;version&gt; with your Maya Version*:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\maya\<version>\scripts`
- Mac: `~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/Maya/<version>/scripts`
- Linux: `~/Maya/<version>/scripts`

## Usage

The scripts will run automatically each time you startup maya.
